Needs chest_xray.zip from this [kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia) in the current directory

Homework was:
Retrain the 'inception v3' image classifier on the pneumonia dataset using Tensorflow+Keras. Create a jupyter notebook of your script and be sure to show the training process as well as 2 examples of it making predictions on images from the testing dataset. This link will give you an idea of how it can be done.
